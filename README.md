# Rusty Inventory Manager: KISS it!

## Mind Blowing, Never Seen Before Features:
 - Insert items as `Key:Value` pairs!

## Built Using AMAZING Technology!
Being written *entirely* using the *safe*, *fast* and *efficient*
[Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), it is 
one of the rustiest inventory managers around!

For the Database, Rusty Inventory Manager uses [sled](https://github.com/spacejam/sled) - ~~it's all downhill from here!!!~~ - do I have to say more? Given the description "the champagne of beta embedded databases", this *has* to be the *best choice available*.

To parse command line input, what better choice than the 
battle tested [clap crate](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap).
It being a "full featured, fast Command Line Argument Parser for Rust", it'll provide you with everything for your Command Line Argument Parsing needs.

## Awesome Project Goals:
 - Keeping It Stupid Simple
 - Provide a sane Command Line Interface

## Intelligent Project Non-Goals*:
 - Never ever will I ever implement web access. If you want to use it over the network, use it via ssh.
 - I won't implement multi user access. That's just to much of a hassle, and I don't need it.
 - Make it scalable to over a bazillion items.

> \* Maybe I will implement some of them either way, but they aren't planned and if there is no interest for them, why bother.
